# Number Arabic Word Converter

A simple JSON API to convert numbers(integers) into their correct arabic text. 
Based on https://github.com/MohsenAlyafei/nArabicWords.

## Why does this exist

Mostly because the algorithm used is the most comprehensive one I saw, 
but its only available in JS and we need it for a different few backens to 
issue arabic documents that for legal purposes need to have the number
written as text.

## How to Use

Dockerimage Pending
